For updating weekly learning and assignments

                                                 Week 1
========================================================================================================
===========================================================================================
In week 1, we were introduced on what is Interactive Development also known as ID. We are also taught to
create our first GitHub page and we are learned on what makes a good webiste.

                                                 Week 2
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 2, we were taught what is html and basic css such as the padding, align-items, how to change 
background color and even text colors. This week is the start of the CAs for us to submit as weekly
practices which also affects our overall grades for this module. So, it is important to submit it on 
time.

                                                 Week 3
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 3, we were taught more advanced css such as learning what media query is and how to make the 
html fit into mobile view for user to use outside, we also learn how to do positioning whether the
position is absolute or relative and also what display flex means. This week also have CAs to submit.
Week 3 is also the start of our Assignment 1 where we create a website of any band or company and it is
a individual assignment.

                                                 Week 4
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 4, it is just a summarise of what we have learned from week 1 to week 3 so its called "putting
it all together". It shows us about mobile view, how to make ur website nice using css and alignments
and learn more about GitHub. This week also have CAs to submit.

                                                 Week 5
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 5, we were introduced to Javascript. However, this week unfortunately it was async learning
where students will revise on their own and watch the video from LinkedIn and try attempt the questions
in LinkedIn and do the CAs. I personally feel that it was not efficient for us to have async learning
as our first lesson for Javascript as Javascript is not an easy thing to understand.

                                                 Week 6
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 6, it is again learning the basics of Javascript but this time is Face To Face lesson which
I think is slightly better as we can clarify our doubts with the lecturers when we do not understand
any part of the Javascript. There is also the weekly CA for us to submit.

                                                 Week 7
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 7, we learned a few things. Firstly we learn what is Document Object Model(DOM) and there is 
something called the DOM Tree. We also learn how to access elements. Next, we learned about Validations
and Event Handling. It is something like creating an event such as onclick when you click, something
happens. Finally, the JSON local storage. We learned how to access storage API and JSON data. For this
week, there is no CA as it is a duplicate from the previous week.

                                                 Week 8
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 8, we learned about what is Jquery and what is API. Jquery makes the Javascript more easier and 
also learned about DOM Travesal meaning the parent,child,sibling structure. As for the API, we get to
know what is Asynchronous Javascript And XML(AJAX) and why we should use AJAX.

                                                 Week 9
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 9, it is another Async lesson where we get to learn what is BootStrap. BootStrap is a place 
where you can get code samples for your project and you can add charts or datas. Again, I feel it was
not a very efficient learning because bootstrap is also quite confusing. After this week, it is our 3 
weeks holiday.

                                                 Week 12
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 12, we were exposed to databases and the database software that we will be using is called
restdb. We were introduce to the features inside restdb and how we can create our own databases. There
is also CA to do for this week and we were told that on Week 13, our assignment 2 will be released.

                                                 Week 13
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 13, this is the beginning of our Assignment 2 and this time it is a paired work. There is a
period of time where I do not have partner to pair with and so I started a few days later. After 1 week,
Natalie asked me if I wanted to pair up with her and then we just paired up and decided to work on the 
topic on E-Commerce which is quite a tough topic to work on if it is not planned properly. (further 
details will be explained later).

                                                 Week 14
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 14, we are all focusing on our Assignment 2 and we are introduced to Lottie Animations where we
can insert animations when we do a "click" or when we load our website. This week, I think I managed to 
get the basic layout of the website out and duplicate for the different html.

                                                 Week 15
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 15, I think I wanted to change the layout for the different htmls and I manage to do finish the
index.html, login.html and contact.html. I was struggling with creating the shop.html because it is
quite difficult to create. There is a checkpoint 1 submission on this week.

                                                 Week 16
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 16, I managed to work out the shop.html and Natalie did the Game.html and profile.html but
there is still errors here and there but wasn't an big issue. But, I faced a lot of issue when commit 
the GitHub because I need to pull and then Commint&Push. It was quite confusing until almost the end of
this week then I get to know how it works. There is a checkpoint 2 submission on this week

                                                 Week 17
========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================
In week 17, also known as the final week of the assignment and also the last week of my Year 1 journey.
We managed to do API, RestDB and fix all the alignment issues and mobile view. However, on the 10/2/2023
we are trying to implement the lottie animation or preloader for index.html and finish up the demo before
2359HR.
